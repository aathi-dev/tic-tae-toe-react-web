# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

today i face a problem : how to send the data from js file to react
Here is my solution :
document.dispatchEvent(new Event('dataReady', { detail: dataFromJS }));
document: This refers to the global document object in the browser's Document Object Model (DOM). It represents the entire HTML document and provides methods and properties to interact with the document.

dispatchEvent(...): This is a method provided by the document object that allows you to dispatch (fire) custom events. Custom events are a way to create and handle your own events in JavaScript. They can be used to signal that something specific has occurred in your application.

new Event('dataReady', { detail: dataFromJS }): This part is creating a new custom event named 'dataReady'. Here's what each part of this event creation means:

'dataReady': This is the name of the custom event. You can choose any name you like, but it's a good practice to use a descriptive name that reflects the purpose of the event.
